JSP -> Jsp is simple view of servlets (Server Side Technology)

1) Syntax:- 

1) Directive:-
	A directive is an instruction provide to the web engine that defines as to how the current jsp page will be processed
	by jsp engine.
	This instruction will be helpfull while converting the jsp documents into servlets for execution.
	
	A) <%@ page %>
		The page directive comprises of  various attributes that decribe about the processing of page such as
		I) language -> default value is java & should be recstricted to java itself. Initially was introduced for
				supporting multiple languages however the draft did not go through we are still using java.

		II) contentType -> Identifies the output that has been generated & rendered via this jsp page.
				   Default value is "text/html".

		III) autoFlush -> Default value true.
				 Identifies the wheather the buffer used by the JspWriter should be automatically flushed or will it be explicetly flush by the programmer.

		IV) buffer -> Specifies the Size of buffer that has to be used for the JspWriter.  Default is 8kb.

		V) errorPage -> Specifies the URL that should be called whenever an unhandled exception takes place on the current page.
		
		VI) isErrorPage -> Defines wheather the current page is An errorPage & makes the implicit exception object avalibale on this page.

		VII) extends->Specifies the base class to be used for the servlet class being generated to an jsp page.

		VIII) import ->  Specify the list of classes that should be imported by the current jsp documents.

		IX) info -> Extra information to be associated with the page which can be accessible via the getServletInfo()

		X) isElIgnored -> Default value is false.Specifies wheather or not to ignore the Expression language.
		
		XI) isThreadSafe -> Default value is true. Identfies the wheather any synchronization issues will be managed by the programmer or will it be the responsibility of the Web Engine.
					The true value indicated the responsibility of the programmer to take care about any synchronization issues.

		XII) session-> Default value is true.Identifies the if the implicit object session may be available on the current jsp page.


	B) <%@ taglib %>
		The taglib directive is used for specifying the third party tag libraries to be used by the current jsp documents.
		It has the attribute the URI & prefix.
			URI -> It identifies the a unique name through which this taglib wil be recongnizable .
			prefix -> And the prefix is like a namespace for all this tags
		
		
	C) <%@ include %>
		It is used to include the contents of another jsp of html documents. Statically at the time of translation to the current jsp document. (Phys)
		(eg> Headers and Footer are same for any web page in my application. Only at one side)

2) Declaration Block -  Data member of class.
	-> <%! %>
		The declaration is used for defining the page level variables or functions that can be accessed throghout 
		the jsp document.

3) Scriptlet:- <%  %>
		A scriptlets is a block of java code that would be embedded within the current jsp documents and would be executed on server side.
		Any Code define within the scriptlet would be replaced within the service method for the generated servlet.
		
			
4) Expression - It should contain the statements which return the value.
		 <%=  %>
		An expression is a single statement that generates an output which would be delivered to the client. It can only contain only one statement not terminating semicolon.

5) EL or Expression Language (jsp 2.0) -> Accessing lot of data.
		-> ${} or #{} -> Own Syntax of pattern is different.
		-> It is convinience syntax introduced for Web Desinger & Programmers to access various implic objects on the current jsp page.

6) Comments.

//single line

/*
	// multi line

/**
*
*	//Documentation comment

	<!-- 
		//JSP/html page comment
	-->
	
2) Implicit Objects - Will be used only in scriptlets & expression.

	These are objects bydefault available within an scriptlets or an expression.


a) request -> HttpServletRequest
b) response -> HttpServletResponse
c) config -> ServletConfig
e) application -> ServletContext
f) session -> HttpSession
g) exception -> Throwable -> Identifies the the exception that has been raised on previous page.
h) page ->  Object -> refer the current object
i) out -> JspWriter
	It is type of JspWriter which uses a buffering mechanism to store the output generated and only once the buffer is full, the contens will be flushed to client steram.

j) pageContext -> PageContext -> Wrapper for all above objects. (Can be used to pass as parameter to function & u will get the all the object all)
	
	It is wrapper object containing all the eight implicit objects within itself.


3) Jsp Taglib/ Jsp Actions (JSTL)

a) <jsp:useBean> scope="page/session/application"> - Populate the bean -> Automatically call the methods internally -> Code behind logic (Dont expose the business logic at jsp side) 

	It is used to instantiate or use Javabeans of POJO Objects on the current jsp dcouments.

b) <jsp:setProperty> 
	Allow us set the datamembers of this bean using this tag.

c) <jsp:getProperty>
	Allow me to retrive the value of property of bean.

d) <jsp:include> -> include the other html code into your code. 
	Dynamically includes a process server side code on the current jsp document.
	(It will execute the next URL & also display the current page output + next page output)

e) <jsp:forward> -> 
	It allows me to forward the request to another URL on server side.
	(It will execute the next URL & only display  next page output)	

f) <jsp:plugin> -> It allows us add the plugins as Applet,flash,windows media player etc on the current jsp docuement.

	 <jsp:fallback>
	 <jsp:param>

	

lifecyle method of jsp:

  _jspInit() {}
	
  _jspDestroy() {}

  _jspService(request, response) {}


Generated Jsp location:

/<workspace>/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.wst.server.core/tmp0/work/Catalina/localhost/<appName>/org/apache/jsp
